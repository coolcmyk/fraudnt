Each object should have the following properties:\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for the message\n* `text`: the text content of the message\n\nThe code loads the JSON file using `json.load()`, and then iterates through the list of messages to store each message's text in a dictionary called `llm_memory`. The key for each message is its `id` property.\n\nYou can modify this code to suit your specific needs, such as loading the conversation history from a different source or adding more features to the LLM memory.\n\nRemember to replace `'conversation_history.json'` with the actual path to your JSON file!"
